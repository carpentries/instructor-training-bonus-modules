## Outline from ITB Online Teaching Onboarding:

### Challenges faced by Instructors
- pacing: more important than ever to go slowly; also harder than ever because online moves slower
- communication: feedback indicates that Instructors leave uncertain about whether they successfully engaged learners. Have to work harder to hear from learners online.
- class size: many groups have been ignoring our advice on keeping online workshops small. There is often institutional pressure to do so. We'd like them to resist!
- slow workshops and anxiety over quality probably both contribute to low response rates on post-assessment. We really want Instructors to find time to distribute surveys before sending people away.  
Work in progress -- as always but especially with new materials, contributions invited!
### Overall structure:
- Breaks: designed for 1 x 15 min, can try 3 x 5 min but keep to time
- "Activity 0" = Zoom hosting
- If you have any groups of 4, 4th group members need to be moved during Activity 0 because time doesn't allow for 4. They can complete Activity 0 during the 4th session (see table below)
- some participants don't feel the need to participate (Zoom experts) -- it's good to ask about this first to give them a chance to opt out
#### Group assignments
Group assignments for activity # during each time period are as follows:  

| Activity session | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group3 | Group 4 |
|------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1                | 0       | 1       | 1      | 1       |
| 2                | 2       | 0       | 2      | 2       |
| 3                | 3       | 3       | 0      | 3       |
| 4 (catch-up)     | 1       | 2       | 3      | 0       |

  
#### Workshop roles
- Discussion Lead (Trainer)
- Zoom Lead (Trainer or Instructor)
#### Modeling introductions
Timing is (of course) tight  
- if you have 4 groups, you *must* preserve time for all 4 activities.
- Content between activities can be more or less interactive, depending on time
- Zoom questions in the initial overview can be punted to Activity 0? (Maybe handled in etherpad then?)
- Cloud instance material is optional
#### Activity 1 overview
- Purpose is to think through technical aspects of communications online and identify potential failure points, solutions
- Challenging to find time to debrief, but important. Making sure they report in the etherpad during breakouts helps to debrief quickly if need be.
#### Activity 2 overview
- Purpose is to prepare participants to empathize with learner experience, then orient towards introducing a workshop in a way that will support those learners.
- The activity itself isn't particularly well-matched to the introductory text. Maybe could be a different activity in the future. But feedback indicates that it's fine and people enjoy the practice introducing their online workshop here.
- Group roles require a reminder.
- Minimal debrief time is ok here -- better to spend that time in the lead-up thinking about learner challenges.
#### Activity 3 overview
- Purpose is to prepare Instructors for the additional planning load and team coherence necessary to make a good online workshop function. 
- It refers them to the planning checklist, which can be overwhelming, but we want them to know about it and figure out how to cope with that now.
- Activity has been updated to ask them to find single examples of things that can be planned asychronously, require a meeting etc. 
- Unlikely to have time to debrief.
#### Assessment
- We will distribute pre and post survey links to participants. We would appreciate it if Zoom Lead could paste the post-survey link into the chat at the end of the workshop.
