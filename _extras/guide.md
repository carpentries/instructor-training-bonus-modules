title: "Instructor Notes"
---
This workshop is designed to be taught by 2 people:
1. An Instructor Trainer who presents content preparing trainees for activities and leads debriefs. This person starts off with the Zoom 'host' role, then passes it to #2 after introducing Activity 0. (Unless #2 wishes to introduce Activity 0, in which case they may retain host throughout.)
2. An Instructor or Instructor Trainer, proficient in Zoom, who models "Zoom DJ" role and also guides trainees through Activity 0

More than any other workshop, the introduction to this workshop should be planned and executed with close attention to detail, because it serves as a model to trainees.
