# The Carpentries Bonus Module Calendar: 2020-2021

Certified Carpentries Instructors can register for events listed below by clicking on the link for that event and completing the registration through Eventbrite.  

All training times are listed in UTC. A link is provided next to each event that will convert the start time to your local time zone.

Read more about our Bonus Modules [here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/instructor-training-bonus-modules/).

The class will be hands-on and interactive. 

Registration for each event closes one week before that event. You may change or cancel your registration up to one week before the event. Cancelations less than one week in advance and no-shows may result in forfeiting your seat.  We do make exceptions to this policy in limited circumstances (e.g. illness), so please do reach out to us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if there was an extenuating circumstance and we will be able to make alternative arrangements for you to join another event.
