## Setting the Stage for a Positive Learner Experience
In Part 1 of this lesson, we talked about the importance of the right tool at the right time in setting the stage for a motivating, focused workshop experience. 
But, there is more to communication than choosing a platform! 

Online learners are most often joining your workshop from home, just as you are likely joining us from your home now, and will very likely be teaching or helping from home! 

'Home' can look very different to different people. Sometimes, features of a home environment can impact participation in an online workshop in new and different 
ways. Some effects can be positive! But where features of a learner's environment create barriers, a little advance planning can go a long way. Consider the home 
enviroment and equipment along with other potential accessibility issues, and plan accommodations wherever possible.

What kind of experience do you want your learners to have? What kinds of things can get in the way, and how can we help?

> ## Solutions (examples)
> Optimal experience:
> - understands the instructor
> - can keep up with live coding
> - feels comfortable asking for help
> - feels like they 'belong' at the workshop
> - leaves feeling like they can continue to learn skills
>
> Barriers:
> * internet 
> * home technology setup (small screen, poor audio/video, installation failures)
> * household distractions (e.g. kids!)
> * 'Zoom fatigue'
> * other accessibility (e.g. need for audio or visual accommodations)
>
> Solutions:
> * Direct learners to curriculum in case they lose connection or need to step away. Follow curriculum.
> * Minimize window-switching and pause to allow learners to juggle screens e.g. when switching to a collaborative document
> * Prepare to use cloud instances if needed, and also provide next steps for after the workshop to learners who use them.
> * Utilize ice-breakers and group activities to help learners feel more comfortable and connect your community
> * Plan for breaks, post the times, and stick to them
> * Consider whether and when to ask learners to turn on their video
> * Where captioning is not an option, assigning a note-taker to directly transcribe

Creating a welcoming environment for your learners starts with teaching them how they can participate in your workshop. You may have the world's most perfect 
plan for every possible contingency, but if your learners don't know how they fit in to that vision, that in itself is a barrier to success.

> ## Activity 3 (20 min)
> - Have a look at the guidelines on our [Recommendations](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#communicate-information-learners-need-to-know) page, and prepare a short (3 minute) segment of your introduction that will set your learners on a course for success.
> - Rehearse! Give everyone a chance to present first, then exchange feedback, starting with feedback on yourself. Feedback should focus primarily on content, but delivery may be relevant too. Remember to include both targeted praise and constructive feedback. 
> - As time allows, share some similarities and differences in introductions within your group in the etherpad.
> - Group 3 completes Activity 0

## Planning your workshop
At this point, you have done quite a bit of work towards planning your workshop. We hope that alone makes your time spent here worthwhile! However, a functioning 
workshop demands teamwork, and this is especially true in an online setting. For in-person workshops, team coordination is ideal, but a workshop can squeak by on 
a rough distribution of teaching duties with a quick helper orientation. Online, everyone needs to be on the same page/communication platform or the workshop is 
really at risk. This means that, before your workshop, you will need to bring everyone together to plan, to share knowledge about your platforms of choice, and 
to distribute roles with regard to communications management.

What makes a good meeting? Generate some ideas as a group, then check below to be sure these items are included:
> ## Solutions
> - A well-structured agenda
> - Meeting roles
> - Notes to record decisions & commitments for future reference
> - Clearly assigned action items
> - Central aims accomplished in allotted time
>

In the next activity, you will work with your group to tease apart the preparation process, separating planning into before- during- and after-the-meeting phases. 

> ## Activity 4 (20 min)
> Take a few minutes to individually review the [planning checklist in the Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#planning-your-workshop)
> This checklist is long! BUT, never fear -- you are working as part of a team. Your team can handle it... if you communicate well!
> Take a few moments to brainstorm the components of a solid team communication strategy. Consider the following questions:
> - How will you communicate before the workshop?
> - What can be done asynchronously and what needs a meeting?
> - How will you communicate during the workshop?
> - What could go wrong, and how will you troubleshoot?
>
> - Group 4 completes Activity 0
