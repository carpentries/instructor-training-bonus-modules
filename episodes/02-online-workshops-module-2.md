## Understanding the Learner Experience
In Part 1 of this lesson, we talked about the importance of the right tool at the right time in setting the stage for a motivating, focused workshop experience. But, there is more to communication than choosing a platform! 

Online learners are most often joining your workshop from home, just as you are likely joining us from your home now, and will very likely be teaching or helping from home! 

'Home' can look very different to different people. Sometimes, features of a home environment can impact participation in an online workshop in new and different ways. Some effects can be positive! But where features of a learner's environment create barriers, it's valuable to plan accommodations wherever possible.

> ## Activity 4 (10 min)
> 
> Brainstorm: 
> 1. What does an optimal learner experience look like? (3 min)
> 2. What can get in the way? (3 min)
> 3. What can you do, either in the design of your workshop or in response to challenges, to address potential barriers to success in your workshop? (4 min)
> 
> - Group 4 completes Activity 0

> ## Solutions (examples)
> Optimal experience:
> - understands the instructor
> - can keep up with live coding
> - feels comfortable asking for help
> - feels like they 'belong' at the workshop
> - leaves feeling like they can continue to learn skills
>
> Barriers:
> * internet 
> * home technology setup (small screen, poor audio/video)
> * household distractions 
> * 'Zoom fatigue'
> * other accessibility (e.g. need for audio or visual accommodations)
>
> Solutions:
> * Direct learners to curriculum in case they lose connection. Follow curriculum.
> * Minimize window-switching and pause to allow learners to juggle screens e.g. when switching to a collaborative document.
> * Utilize ice-breakers and group activities to help learners feel more comfortable
> * Consider whether and when to ask learners to turn on their video
> * Where captioning is not an option, assigning a note-taker to directly transcribe

## Planning your workshop
At this point, you have done quite a bit of work towards planning your workshop. We hope that alone makes your time spent here worthwhile! However, a functioning 
workshop demands teamwork, and this is especially true in an online setting. For in-person workshops, team coordination is ideal, but a workshop can squeak by on 
a rough distribution of teaching duties with a quick helper orientation. Online, everyone needs to be on the same page/communication platform or the workshop is 
really at risk. This means that, before your workshop, you will need to bring everyone together to plan, to share knowledge about your platforms of choice, and 
to distribute roles with regard to communications management.

What makes a good meeting? Generate some ideas as a group, then check below to be sure these items are included:
> ## Solutions
> - A well-structured agenda
> - Meeting roles
> - Notes to record decisions & commitments for future reference
> - Clearly assigned action items
> - Central aims accomplished in allotted time
> 
{: .solution}
In the next activity, you will work with your group to tease apart the preparation process, separating planning into before- during- and after-the-meeting phases. 

> ## Activity 5 (10 min)
> Work together to address the following questions in the Etherpad:
> 1. Make a list in the Etherpad. What kinds of things need to be planned / agreed upon in advance of the workshop? (4 min)
> 2. Sort your list! (3 min)
> - What can be established before the meeting (asynchronously)?
> - What needs to happen during the meeting?
> - What can happen as follow-up to the meeting? 
> 3. Draft a meeting agenda (individually or as a group) in the Etherpad (3 min)
> - Group 5 completes Activity 0

## Practice
Practice does not "make perfect" without deliberate attention to feedback!

For the remainder of our activity time, you will have an opportunity to rehearse components of your workshop in your groups. In the first activity, you will focus 
primarily on *content* (remember that 2x2 rubric from [Instructor Training?](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html)), introducing your learners to the nuts and bolts of your online workshop. In the second activity, you will practice live coding. Unlike
our Instructor Training workshop, however, here you should be mindful of the features of your *delivery* that may be unique to the online learning 
environment. When observing the demos of others, your experience in the learner role is equally important to the practice with instruction. Depending on the 
lesson, it may not be practical for everyone to 'code along' with the time limits, but you can still take a moment to set up your viewing environment to 
approximate that of a learner with a single laptop screen.


> ## Activity 6 (10 min)
> What do your learners need to know about how to get the most out of your workshop? How will you teach them to participate? 
> - Write and rehearse an introduction to your online workshop. Aim for no more than 3 minutes. Assume that your introduction to the workshop content -- i.e. what they can expect to learn -- will occur either before or after this segment. 
> - Give everyone a chance to present first, then exchange feedback, starting with feedback on yourself. Feedback should focus primarily on content, but delivery may be relevant too. Remember to include both positive and negative comments.
> - As time allows, share some similarities and differences in introductions within your group in the etherpad.
> - Group 6 completes Activity 0
{: .challenge}



> ## Activity 7 (20 min)
> - Take turns presenting and observing the 'learner view' of a 3 minute live coding segment for your workshop.
> - In this case, it is probably best to provide feedback immediately after each section is complete. Start with the presenter giving feedback on themselves. Feedback should mainly be focused on the online teaching and learning environment. A little general feedback is ok, but keep an eye on the time.
> - Groups 7 and 8 complete Activity 0 (1st and 2nd half). Note that both groups will have an opportunity to complete this activity promptly using the extra time in Activity 8.

> ## Activity 8 (10 min)
> - Each group should discuss or complete the activity they missed while doing Activity 0.
