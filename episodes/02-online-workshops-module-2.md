# Part 2

## Understanding the Learner Experience
In Part 1 of this workshop, we talked about the importance of the right tool at the right time in setting the stage for a motivating, focused workshop experience. But, there is more to communication than choosing a platform! 

Online learners are most often joining your workshop from home, just as you are likely joining us from your home now, and will very likely be teaching or helping from home! 

'Home' can look very different to different people, however. Sometimes, features of a home environment can limit participation in an online workshop in new and different ways.

[Alternatively.. learner profiles here?]
> ## Activity 5 (10 min)
> 
> Brainstorm: 
> 1. What does an optimal learner experience look like? (3 min)
> 2. What can get in the way? (3 min)
> 3. What can you do, either in the design of your workshop or in response to challenges, to address potential barriers to success in your workshop? (4 min)
> 
> - Group 4 completes Activity 1

(solutions drop-down)
> ## Solutions
> Optimal experience:
> - understands the instructor
> - can keep up with live coding
> - feels comfortable asking for help
> - feels like they 'belong' at the workshop
> - leaves feeling like they can continue to learn skills
>
> Barriers:
> * internet 
> * home technology setup (small screen, poor audio/video)
> * household distractions 
> * other accessibility (e.g. need for audio or visual accommodations)
>
> Solutions:
> * Direct learners to curriculum in case they lose connection. Follow curriculum.
> * Minimize window-switching and pause to allow learners to juggle screens e.g. when switching to a collaborative document.
> * Where captioning isn't an option, assigning a note-taker to directly transcribe

## Planning your workshop
At this point, you have done quite a bit of work towards planning your workshop. We hope that alone makes your time spent here worthwhile! However, a functioning workshop demands teamwork, and this is especially true in an online setting. For in-person workshops, team coordination is ideal, but a workshop can squeak by on a rough distribution of teaching duties with a quick helper orientation. Online, everyone needs to be on the same page/communication platform or the workshop is really at risk. This means that, before your workshop, you will need to bring everyone together to plan, to share knowledge about your platforms of choice, and to distribute roles with regard to communications management.

What makes a good meeting? Generate some ideas as a group, then check below to be sure these items are included:
> ## Solutions
> - A well-structured agenda
> - Meeting roles
> - Notes to record decisions & commitments for future reference
> - Clearly assigned action items
> - Central aims accomplished in allotted time
> 
{: .solution}
In the next activity, you will work with your group to tease apart the preparation process, separating planning into before- during- and after-the-meeting phases. 

> ## Activity 6 (10 min)
> Work together to address the following questions in the etherpad:
> 1. Make a list in the etherpad. What kinds of things need to be planned / agreed upon in advance of the workshop? (4 min)
> 2. Sort your list! (3 min)
> - What can be established before the meeting (asynchronously)?
> - What needs to happen during the meeting?
> - What can happen as follow-up to the meeting?
> 3. Draft a meeting agenda (individually or as a group) (3 min)
> - Group 5 completes Activity 1

## Practice
Practice doesn't "make perfect" without deliberate attention to feedback!

> ## Activity 7 (10 min)
> - Write and rehearse the non-technical portion of an online workshop introduction
> - Group 6 completes Activity 1
{: .challenge}

> ## Activity 8 (20 min)
> - Take turns presenting and giving feedback on a 5 minute live coding segment of a workshop
> - Groups 6 and 7 complete Activity 1 (1st and 2nd half). Note that both groups will have an opportunity to complete this activity promptly using the extra time in Activity 8.
{: .challenge}


> ## Activity 9 (10 min)
> - Each group discusses or completes the activity they missed while doing Activity 1.
