## Introduction
If you’ve been following The Carpentries for a while, you may have observed that online workshops have not only been absent from our recommendations; they have been actively discouraged. This is because a number of Carpentries teaching practices do not naturally transfer to a video conferencing platform. Among the challenges:

* A video conferencing window occupies **space on a learner’s computer**. Add a coding window and a collaborative document on a small laptop screen, and you’ve got a challenge unto itself – independent of the lesson's content.
* Learners’ **faces are hidden**, especially during screen sharing, which makes it much harder for the instructional team to evaluate how learners are handling the material by observing facial expressions.
* **No sticky notes!** And asking learners to raise their hands in the chat can be confusing.
* **Side conversations** present a challenge. In a video conference it’s not possible to talk quietly in the back of the room while instruction continues. Conversations between helpers and learners as well as those within the instructional team need to be routed elsewhere.
* **Helpers can’t “drive.”** As much as we recommend against typing on a learner’s machine, this is sometimes necessary for complex problems. Remote control of learner machines is not straightforward.
* **Socialization** doesn’t ‘just happen’. Learners can’t chat with a neighbor or socialise around the snack table during a break.

We'll talk about each of these challenges in the course of this workshop. 

In the first part of the workshop, we'll talk about technology. With the recent global lockdowns, many have had an opportunity to become more familiar with video conferencing and remote collaboration platforms. However, the ways in which these work well or present challenges in the context of a workshop can still be surprising! You'll get some practice using the tools we use, some opportunities to discuss their merits and alternatives, and some time to think through what kind of onboarding your learners will need -- in addition to the content of your workshop!

After the break, we will come back to talk about *teaching*. If you are taking this workshop, you have previously taken The Carpentries [Instructor Training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). Everything you learned there still applies! But how? We will talk about the mechanics of an online workshop -- how the timing, communications strategies, feedback, and teamwork can create a positive learning environment. We will brainstorm challenges and demotivating scenarios to avoid. And last but certainly not least, you will have an opportunity to practice your live coding and participate in feedback specific to the online workshop setting.

Please note that this workshop is intended to supplement, but not to replace The Carpentries [Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/). Be sure to read those recommendations carefully, and check for useful updates each time you teach!

> ## Introduce yourself!
> In the Etherpad, please sign in with your name, pronouns, and a fun fact about yourself. Also, please add your name and pronouns in the upper right corner of the pad, and select your favorite color to display with your text. 
> 
> Be sure to share your introductions again during your first group activity of the day.

## How to Host a Workshop: a technical guide
The video conferencing platform used by The Carpentries is Zoom. However, your hosting organisation may have another platform. 

> ## What platform will you use?
> In the Etherpad, please indicate with an "X" which platform you will be using for your workshop. If you don't see yours listed, please add it.
{: .challenge}

We will now spend a little time discussing and demonstrating the host role on Zoom. We will also have an activity that you'll rotate through in groups throughout the workshop, where you will have an opportunity to test the host controls. However, if you have questions about other platforms at any point during the workshop, we'd like to do what we can to address them. Please ask -- and answer, if you can! -- any questions specific to your platform in the space under your platform name on the Etherpad. Questions that can't be addressed during the workshop will be directed to our infrastructure team, so be sure to add your email address if you'd like us to follow up!

### Host Powers on Zoom
When you enter a Carpentries Zoom room, you won't have host controls. One person on your instructional team will use a "host key" provided in your introductory email to "Claim Host". 

![Claim Host]({{ page.root }}/fig/claim_host.png)

After that, you can only become the host if a current host passes that status to you.

As host, you can:

- **Pass host or assign a co-host.** Co-hosts have some (but not all) of the same privileges as hosts. We recommend that the person teaching use a co-host role, and leaving host powers for someone who has their full attention on managing the meeting.

![](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_4a6257974f2051d955bcab837b3eb361.png)

- **Enable waiting rooms.** This allows you to admit people individually and adds a layer of protection against "zoombombers." The host can communicate with people in waiting rooms by issuing announcements, but cannot communicate directly with individuals in the waiting room. People in the waiting room can not message the host. 

![](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_ae79a48f9d0cc95fdfefb1018a22c59c.png)

- **Mute and unmute participants.** In Carpentries rooms, participants can unmute themselves by default, but this setting can be changed by the host if you want or need to enforce muting. This role can also be performed by co-hosts.

- **Turn off (but not on) participants' video.** Rather than turning the video back on, Zoom will send a request to the participant to activate their video.

- **Create and manage breakout rooms.** These are useful for socialisation and group activities. Only the host can create breakout rooms. We suggest creating an extra room or two just in case.

- **Control screen sharing.** In Carpentries rooms, only the host can screen share by default. 

![](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_585922dda9269703b00758871315bb2e.png)

![](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_7345f3058ec6badcd594b27923dd361a.png)

- **End meeting for all.** If you have host powers and depart the meeting, take care not to take everyone else with you if the workshop is not finished! If you do not end the meeting, Zoom will prompt you to pass off host to another participant before you leave.


> ## Activity 1 (to be carried out in parallel with other activities)
> - Group 1 takes turns 
>     - receiving & passing off host status
>     - muting/unmuting
>     - screenshare/controlling screenshare
>     - waiting room?
>     - receiving co-host status
>     - managing, messaging, and visiting breakouts (but not creating them)
{: .challenge}

Since this activity will be carried out during other activities, be aware that people will be playing with the host features for our meeting during your breakout sessions! This will mean someone might enter your breakout room for a visit, or you might see a silly message posted from time to time. If any other strange things happen... please be patient with us! :)

## Interacting with your Learners Online

At all Carpentries workshops, we take the quality of our communications seriously. We communicate to inspire, sharing our enthusiasm while being mindful of demotivating language and systemic bias. We communicate to re-frame errors as opportunities for learning. And of course we communicate to teach, focusing our learners on precisely what they need to know, and avoiding extraneous cognitive load.  

At an in-person workshop, we communicate with words, with sticky-notes, with smiles and gestures and glances and reassuring presence. Words may be shouted from the front of the room or whispered over the shoulder, by a neighbor, or in the hall during breaks.

Online, most of these communication routes need a new home. In a video conference, only one person can speak at a time. Want to raise your hand? How will you do that? You might:
- wave at the camera
- write "hand" in the chat
- find a little hand-like symbol somewhere
- unmute yourself and try to cut in

Then, there is the problem of side conversations. In a video conference, unless you create breakout rooms, all vocal communication is shared with the entire workshop. One natural outlet for these conversations is the chat... but if that is your only outlet, social clutter can make it unusable.

These are two examples of challenges presented by the video conferencing environment that might send a workshop spinning into dysfunction. But, we have all had some practice with video meetings by now, and unless you are exceptionally lucky you have had a few experiences that might contribute to your ideas about what *not* to do.

During this activity, you will begin by spending about 5 minutes brainstorming with your group to think through some worst-case scenarios for communications between learners and the instructional team. You do not need to consider communications *within* the instructional team (e.g. between Helpers and Instructors) just yet -- we will discuss that soon. 

> ## Activity 2 (15 min): 
> - Groups 2-5:
>     - Introduce yourselves!
>     - Assign group roles: moderator, time keeper, note-taker. (Plan to rotate these as much as possible/practical)
>     - 5 minutes brainstorm worst case scenarios for video conferencing communications
>     - 5 minutes draft solutions/ pre-emptive plans to create a best-case scenario
> - Group 1:
>     - Introduce yourselves!
>     - Complete Activity 1 in cooperation with your Trainer

## Introduction to Cloud Instances for Carpentries Workshops

At Carpentries workshops, we want learners to [use their own machines](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/#learners-use-their-own-machines) 
as much as possible. This leaves them more prepared to continue learning after the workshops.  However, troubleshooting software 
installation problems can be a tremendous challenge even at an in-person event. 

In online workshops, the inability to fully view or interact directly with a learner's machine can make difficult problems functionally
unsolvable. Therefore, The Carpentries now provides cloud instances for each curriculum, pre-loaded with all required software and data.
These are intended to function as **backups** for learners who are experiencing significant installation difficulties. 

There are two main types of cloud instances to be used for Carpentries workshops, each appropriate for different lessons:

- **RStudio Cloud**
    - R-based lessons
    - Git lessons
- **MyBinder**
    - Python-based lessons
    - Shell lessons (in the absence of R or Git)

RStudio Cloud
- Requires sign-in
- Starts up quickly
- Identical interface to RStudio
- Saves work (learners copy the instance to their own account)
- Does not include nano text editor (must use RStudio text editor)


MyBinder
- Does not require sign-in
- Can be slow to load if not used in previous 12 hours
- Identical interface to Jupyter Hub & Jupyter Lab
- Does not save work (must save notebooks and modified data to desktop and re-upload)
- Session stops after 10 minutes inactivity
- Non-private session means that login information should not be used. **Do not connect to GitHub from MyBinder.**
- Has nano text editor installed

You will receive links to backup solutions for your workshop a pre-workshop email sent by our workshop coordinators. This email will also
include information about the caveats discussed above and a link to detailed instructions for learners, including screenshots. We
recommend that you **only share this information with those learners who have not successfully completed installation on their own
computer once the workshop has begun.**


> ## Activity 3 (10 min): 
> 1. Look [here](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/workshop-coordination.md#links-to-lessons) for a link to the cloud instance for a workshop you'd like to teach.
> 2. Try it out! More details on Rstudio instances are [here](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/r.md). More details on Binder instances are [here](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/python.md). Feel free to explore on your own, or try the following:
> - Rstudio:
>     - Start Rstudio cloud and sign in
>     - Make a copy of the project
>     - Create an R script and save it to the project
>     - Exit the project
>     - lLog back in and find your script
> - Binder: 
>     - Wait for your Binder instance to load
>     - Create a new notebook
>     - Write a short script
>     - Save notebook to your own desktop
>     - Close and reload Binder instance
>     - Repopulate with saved notebook
> 
> 3. As a group, brainstorm and write in the Etherpad:
> - ~3 ways you think a learner might have difficulty with a cloud instance
> - ~3 ways that difficulty could be resolved or pre-empted
> - Any questions that you have*
> 
> *Questions that can't be answered during the workshop may be directed to our support team by emailing team@carpentries.org. 
> 
> - Group 2 completes Activity 1

## Behind-the-Scenes: communicating with your instructional team
So far we have discussed challenges and solutions for interacting with your learners. However, another missing piece in the online environment is the ability for instructors and helpers to chat during breaks or otherwise communicate about the progress of the workshop. 

As noted in our earlier conversations, a noisy chat can create real problems for learners trying to communicate with the Instructor. So, the instructional team needs a plan.

In the next activity, consider the many different things that an instructional team might want or need to communicate during a workshop. For example, a helper might not know how to solve a problem that a learner has asked about, and may need to reach out to others to help *them*. What other 'use cases' can you think of for communications within the instructional team?

> ## Activity 4 (10 min): 
> - Identify use cases for behind-the-scenes conversations (3 min)
> - Brainstorm a few worst case scenarios for these use cases (3 min)
> - Individually, draft a plan for communication within the instructional team that you think would work well for your workshop. Write this in the etherpad. (4 min)
> - Group 3 completes Activity 1
