## Introduction
If you have been following The Carpentries for a while, you may have observed that online workshops have not only been absent from our recommendations; they have been actively discouraged. This is because a number of Carpentries teaching practices do not naturally transfer to a video conferencing platform. Among the challenges:

* A video conferencing window occupies **space on a learner’s computer**. Add a coding window and a collaborative document on a small laptop screen, and you have got a challenge unto itself – independent of the lesson's content.
* Learners’ **faces are hidden**, especially during screen sharing, which makes it much harder for the instructional team to evaluate how learners are handling the material by observing facial expressions.
* **No sticky notes!** And asking learners to raise their hands in the chat can be confusing.
* **Side conversations** present a challenge. In a video conference it’s not possible to talk quietly in the back of the room while instruction continues. Conversations between helpers and learners as well as those within the instructional team need to be routed elsewhere.
* **Helpers can’t “drive.”** As much as we recommend against typing on a learner’s machine, this is sometimes necessary for complex problems. Remote control of learner machines is not straightforward.
* **Socialization** doesn’t ‘just happen’. Learners can’t chat with a neighbor or socialise around the snack table during a break.

We will talk about each of these challenges in the course of this workshop. 

In the first part of the workshop, we will talk about technology. With the recent global lockdowns, many have had an opportunity to become more familiar with video conferencing and remote collaboration platforms. However, the ways in which these work well or present challenges in the context of a workshop can still be surprising! You will get some practice using the tools we use, some opportunities to discuss their merits and alternatives, and some time to think through what kind of onboarding your learners will need -- in addition to the content of your workshop!

After the break, we will come back to talk about *teaching*. If you are taking this workshop, you have previously taken The Carpentries [Instructor Training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). Everything you learned there still applies! But how? We will talk about the mechanics of an online workshop -- how technology and teamwork can create a positive learning environment in your workshop. We will brainstorm challenges and demotivating scenarios to avoid. And last but certainly not least, you will have an opportunity to practice introducing your workshop and participate in feedback specific to the online  setting.

Please note that this workshop is intended to supplement, but not to replace The Carpentries [Recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/). Be sure to read those recommendations carefully, and check for useful updates each time you teach!


## How to Host a Workshop: a technical guide
The video conferencing platform used by The Carpentries is Zoom. However, your hosting organisation may have another platform. 

> ## What platform will you use?
> In the Etherpad, please indicate with an "X" which platform you will be using for your workshop. If you do not see yours listed, please add it.
> - Zoom
> - Jitsi
> - WebEx
> - Skype
> - Blackboard
> - Google Meet or Hangouts
> - Other (please add!)
{: .challenge}

We will now spend a little time discussing and demonstrating the host role on Zoom. We will also have an activity that you will rotate through in groups 
throughout the workshop, where you will have an opportunity to test the host controls. However, if you have questions about other platforms at any point during 
the workshop, we would like to do what we can to address them. Please ask -- and answer, if you can! -- any questions specific to your platform in the space 
under your platform name on the Etherpad. Questions that cannot be addressed during the workshop will be directed to our infrastructure team, so be sure to add 
your email address if you would like us to follow up!

> ## Trainers' Note
>
> Be sure the person who is actively teaching has host privileges before beginning this activity. 
> Check the "Optimize Screen Share for Video Clip" box in the sharing window and share Desktop to display zoom features.

### Host Powers on Zoom
When you enter a Carpentries Zoom room, you will not have host controls. One person on your instructional team will use a "host key" provided in your 
introductory email to "Claim Host". Below is a screenshot, as the host of your current session will be unable to display this during demonstration:

![Claim Host]({{ page.root }}/fig/claim_host.png)

Once host has been claimed, you can only become the host when a current host passes that status to you.

As host, you can:

- **Pass host or assign a co-host.** Co-hosts have some (but not all) of the same privileges as hosts. We recommend that the person teaching use a co-host role, and leaving host powers for someone who has their full attention on managing the meeting.

- **Enable and move participants to a waiting room.** This allows you to admit people individually and adds a layer of protection against "zoombombers." The host can 
communicate with people in waiting rooms by issuing announcements, but cannot communicate directly with individuals in the waiting room. People in the waiting 
room can not message the host. 

- **Mute (but not unmute) participants.** In Carpentries rooms, participants are allowed to unmute themselves by default, but this setting can be changed by the 
host if you want or need to enforce muting. This role can also be performed by co-hosts. Rather than unmuting, Zoom will send a request to the participant to unmute.

- **Turn off (but not on) participants' video.** Rather than turning the video back on, Zoom will send a request to the participant to activate their video.

- **Create and manage breakout rooms.** These are useful for socialisation and group activities. Only the host can create breakout rooms. We suggest creating an extra room or two just in case.

- **Control screen sharing.** In Carpentries rooms, only the host can screen share by default. 

- **End meeting for all.** If you have host powers and depart the meeting, take care not to take everyone else with you if the workshop is not finished! If you do not end the meeting, Zoom will prompt you to pass off host to another participant before you leave.


> ## Activity 0 (to be carried out in parallel with other activities)
> - Group 1 takes turns 
>     - receiving host status
>     - assigning co-host status (to another group member)
>     - muting/unmuting
>     - sending a participant to the waiting room (a group member who is not co-host)
>     - screensharing
>     - adjusting screensharing limits
>     - managing, messaging, and visiting breakouts (but not creating them)
{: .challenge}

Since this activity will be carried out during other activities, be aware that people will be playing with the host features for our meeting during your breakout sessions! This will mean someone might enter your breakout room for a visit, or you might see a silly message posted from time to time. If any other strange things happen... please be patient with us! :)

## Interacting with your Learners Online

At all Carpentries workshops, we take the quality of our communications seriously. We communicate to inspire, sharing our enthusiasm while being mindful of demotivating language and systemic bias. We communicate to re-frame errors as opportunities for learning. And of course we communicate to teach, focusing our learners on precisely what they need to know, and avoiding extraneous cognitive load.  

At an in-person workshop, we communicate with words, with sticky-notes, with smiles and gestures and glances and reassuring presence. Words may be shouted from the front of the room or whispered over the shoulder, by a neighbor, or in the hall during breaks.

Online, most of these communication routes need a new home. In a video conference, only one person can speak at a time. Want to raise your hand? Writing "hand" in the chat as we did above is not the only route, nor is it normally the first thing new users will try. You might:
- wave at the camera (if video is on)
- unmute yourself and try to cut in
- discover a little hand-like symbol and click it
- add your question/comment to the chat instead
- freeze, with an acute case of "analysis paralysis"


Then, there is the problem of side conversations. In a video conference, unless you create breakout rooms, all vocal communication is shared with the entire workshop. One natural outlet for these conversations is the chat... but if that is your only outlet, social clutter can make it unusable.

These are two examples of challenges presented by the video conferencing environment that might send a workshop spinning into dysfunction. But, we have all had some practice with video meetings by now, and unless you are exceptionally lucky you have had a few experiences that might contribute to your ideas about what *not* to do.

During this activity, you will begin by spending about 5 minutes brainstorming with your group to think through some worst-case scenarios for communications between learners and the instructional team. You do not need to consider communications *within* the instructional team (e.g. between Helpers and Instructors) just yet -- we will discuss that soon. 

> ## Activity 1 (20 min): 
> - Groups 2+:
>     - Introduce yourselves!
>     - Assign group roles: moderator, time keeper, note-taker. Also, designate one person to share a few key points or questions with the class when you return. Plan to rotate these roles as much as possible/practical as we move through the activities today.
>     - 5 minutes: brainstorm potential communications failures that may occur during a workshop. 
>     - 5 minutes: draft solutions/ pre-emptive plans to create a best-case scenario for communications during your workshop.
>  
> - Group 1:
>     - Introduce yourselves!
>     - Complete Activity 0 in cooperation with your Trainer
>     - Take note of the role assignment instructions above for your next activity.
