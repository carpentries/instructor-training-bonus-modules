<p>This workshop in intended to be taught by two people. The Discussion
Lead should be a Carpentries Instructor Trainer and the Zoom Lead may be
a Trainer or Instructor.</p>
<p>Discussion Lead: Introduces the workshop, facilitates icebreakers and
discussions of all activities except Activity 0 (using Host powers in
Zoom).</p>
<p>Zoom Lead: Assumes (&amp; transfers) âhostâ role in Zoom, manages
breakouts &amp; waiting room, monitors chat, mutes noise, keeps time.
Facilitates Activity 0. If you wish to demonstrate Zoom captioning, the
Zoom Lead can take on this role when participants introduce themselves,
since it is not necessary to take notes then.</p>

<p>The introductory procedures for this workshop should present an ideal
model to attendees. This means paying attention to <em>all</em> the
details, even though some may feel less necessary for a short and small
event of this kind. Later activities can then reference practices
displayed here.</p>
<p>*Hello! My name is [ name ] and I will be your Discussion Lead for
today. As a Carpentries event, this workshop is covered by The
Carpentries Code of Conduct. That means we will all bring our best
selves to support each other in preparing to teach online here today. If
you have any concerns you will find links for reporting in the
Etherpad.</p>
<p>Before we get started I want to be sure that we all have a plan
should anyone lose their connection, including me. We will be using the
Etherpad to keep notes and links. You will find a link to rejoin this
meeting there, as well as links to the curriculum. Please be sure you
have the Etherpad link available someplace other than our meeting chat.
You may be able to send messages there if your call drops. If I lose
connection, our Zoom Lead, [ name ] will take over. If the call ends,
you should be able to reconnect using the information you originally
came with. Should we have a general failure I will contact folks by
email when I can. This is a 3 hour workshop with a 15 minute break in
the middle. We will take our break at 30 minutes past the next hour
regardless of where we are in the curriculum at that time.</p>
<p>The curriculum is primarily for reference outside the workshop, so
donât worry about trying to display it or juggling it with your Zoom
screen. You may want to take a moment to arrange your windows so that
you can <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training-bonus-modules/fig/ScreenOrganization.png" class="external-link">see
the Etherpad and Zoom at the same time</a>. If you prefer to alternate,
I will also tell you when we need to move between them. If you need any
direct assistance during the workshop, you may message [name of Zoom
lead] in the chat. Note that you can send private messages by selecting
someoneâs name in the dropdown next to the âTo:â in the chat window.</p>
<p>In the first exercise, weâll be doing Introductions â in addition to
breaking the ice, we will also be practising one mode of handraising. As
we will discuss there are many ways to raise hands in Zoom, and you may
try them all, but writing âhandâ in the chat is the method Iâll be
paying most attention to today. Please open the Etherpad using the link
in the chat if you have not already done so, sign in there, and then
write âhandâ in the chat.*</p>
<p><em>(Optional) During your Introductions [name of Zoom lead] will be
demonstrating Zoomâs manual captioning feature. They will transition to
taking notes in the Etherpad after that.</em></p>

<p>In the Etherpad, please sign in with your name, pronouns, and a fun
fact about your local area. Note that you can customize your color at
the top right. Also, in Zoom, please adjust your name as needed and add
pronouns. You can do this by clicking the drop-down to the right of your
name in the participants window.</p>
<p>When you are finished, please raise your hand by writing âhandâ in
the chat. When the Trainer calls on you, unmute and briefly say your
name and location (city, country). Weâll save the fun facts for your
first breakout sessions.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Prior to 2020, The Carpentries discouraged online workshops. This is
because a number of Carpentries teaching practices do not naturally
transfer to a video conferencing platform. Among the challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>A video conferencing window occupies <strong>space on a learnerâs
computer</strong>.</li>
<li>Learnersâ <strong>faces are hidden</strong> which makes it much
harder for the instructional team to evaluate how learners are handling
the material by observing facial expressions.</li>
<li>
<strong>No sticky notes!</strong> And asking learners to raise their
hands in the chat can be confusing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Side conversations</strong> present a challenge. In a video
conference itâs not possible to talk quietly in the back of the room
while instruction continues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Helpers canât âdrive.â</strong> As much as we recommend
against typing on a learnerâs machine, this is sometimes necessary for
complex problems. Remote control of learner machines is not
straightforward.</li>
<li>
<strong>Socialization</strong> doesnât âjust happenâ. Learners canât
chat with a neighbor or socialise around the snack table during a
break.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about each of these challenges in the course of this
workshop.</p>
<p>In the first part of the workshop, we will talk about technology. You
will get some practice using the tools we use, some opportunities to
discuss their merits and alternatives, and some time to think through
what kind of onboarding your learners will need to participate
successfully!</p>
<p>After the break, we will come back to talk about <em>teaching</em>.
Everything you learned in The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/" class="external-link">Instructor
Training workshop</a> still applies, but how? We will talk about the
mechanics of an online workshop â how technology and teamwork can create
a positive learning environment in your workshop.</p>
<p>Please note that this workshop is intended to supplement, but not to
replace The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/" class="external-link">Recommendations
for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online</a>. Be sure to read those
recommendations carefully, and check for useful updates each time you
teach!</p>

in groups throughout the workshop, where you will have an opportunity to
test the host controls. However, if you have questions about other
platforms at any point during the workshop, please ask â and answer, if
you can! â any questions specific to your platform in the space under
your platform name on the Etherpad. Questions that cannot be addressed
during the workshop will be directed to our infrastructure team, so be

</h3>
<p>When you enter a Carpentries Zoom room, you will not have host
controls. One person on your instructional team will use a âhost keyâ
provided in your introductory email to âClaim Hostâ. The button looks
like this:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/claim_host.png" alt="Screenshot of zoom, with claim host circled in red, indicating how to claim host." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once host has been claimed, you can only become the host when a
current host passes that status to you.</p>
<p>As host, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pass host or assign a co-host.</strong> <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362603-Host-and-co-host-controls-in-a-meeting" class="external-link">Co-hosts</a>
have some of the same privileges as hosts. We recommend that the person
teaching use a co-host role, and leaving host powers for someone who has
their full attention on managing the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enable and move participants to a waiting room.</strong>
This allows you to admit people individually and adds a layer of
protection against âzoombombers.â The host can communicate with people
in waiting rooms by issuing announcements. People in the waiting room
can not message the host. Take care to press âAdmitâ if you want to let
someone back in â âRemoveâ can sound like a good idea but will kick the
person out of the meeting, in some cases permanently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mute participants or request they unumute
themselves.</strong> In Carpentries rooms, participants are allowed to
unmute themselves by default, but this setting can be changed by the
host or co-host if you want or need to enforce muting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn off (but not on) participantsâ video.</strong>
Rather than turning the video back on, Zoom will send a request to the
participant to activate their video.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create and manage breakout rooms.</strong> <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Breakout-Rooms" class="external-link">Breakout
rooms</a> are useful for socialisation and group activities. We suggest
creating an extra room or two just in case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control screen sharing.</strong> In Carpentries rooms,
only the host can screen share by default. However, the host can change
the screen sharing permissions to allow co-hosts and/or participants to
screenshare.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>End meeting for all.</strong> If you have host powers and
depart the meeting, take care not to take everyone else with you if the
workshop is not finished! If you do not end the meeting, Zoom will
prompt you to pass off host to another participant before you
leave.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Zoom updates features frequently, so it is important to expect the
unexpected! Making sure that everyone is running the most up-to-date
version of Zoom can help, but invariably a percentage of attendees will
not remember to update. In addition, you may also find that features you
were planning to use have changed with new updates. When in doubt, check

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>At all Carpentries workshops, we take the quality of our
communications seriously. We communicate to inspire, to re-frame errors
as opportunities for learning, and, of course, to teach. At an in-person
workshop, we communicate with words, with sticky-notes, with smiles and
gestures and glances and reassuring presence.</p>
<p>Online, most of these communication routes need a new home. In a
video conference, only one person can speak at a time. Want to raise
your hand? Writing âhandâ in the chat as we did above is not the only
route, nor is it normally the first thing new users will try. You
might:</p>
<ul>
<li>wave at the camera (if video is on)</li>
<li>unmute yourself and try to cut in</li>
<li>discover a little hand-like symbol and click it</li>
<li>add your question/comment to the chat instead</li>
<li>freeze, with an acute case of âanalysis paralysisâ</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, there is the problem of side conversations. In a video
conference, unless you create breakout rooms, all vocal communication is
shared with the entire workshop. One natural outlet for these
conversations is the chatâ¦ but if that is your only outlet, social
clutter can make it unusable.</p>
<p>We have all had some practice with video meetings by now, and unless
you are exceptionally lucky you have had a few experiences that might
contribute to your ideas about what <em>not</em> to do.</p>
<p>During this activity, you will begin by spending about 5 minutes
brainstorming with your group to think through some worst-case scenarios
for communications between learners and the instructional team, or
within the instructional team.</p>

possible/practical as we move through the activities today.</li>
<li>Consider one of the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Total Eclipse of the Chat:</strong> Instructor is talking
and someone (or multiple people) have a question, but the Instructor is
not paying attention to the conference chat.</li>
<li>
<strong>Which Chat?:</strong> A learner asks for help using the
Etherpad chat, when all the helpers are watching the Zoom chat. They are
stuck for a long time without help.</li>
<li>
<strong>Banter Blast:</strong> A group of enthusiastic learners uses
the Zoom chat for a side conversation about favorite related tools. A
request for help gets lost in the noise.</li>
<li>
<strong>Help the Helper:</strong> A helper engages with a learner
and encounters a problem they donât know how to solve. Now the helper
needs help and isnât sure how to proceed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Which Hand?:</strong> You have asked learners to raise hands
by writing âhandâ in the chat, but one person is waving at the screen,
another is using the âraise handâ button, and neither is being called on
by the Instructor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Breakout Amnesia:</strong> Learners have entered breakout
rooms to complete an activity. Once they are there, they realize they do
not understand the prompt, but do not know how to ask for help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draft solutions or pre-emptive plans to create a best-case scenario

a countdown timer for breakout rooms. After creating the breakout rooms,
click Options to view additional breakout rooms options. Check Set
Countdown timer: If this option is checked, the participants will be

<p>Online learners are most often joining your workshop from home and
will very likely be teaching or helping from home!</p>
<p>âHomeâ can look very different to different people. Sometimes,
features of a home environment can impact participation in an online
workshop. Some effects can be positive, but some can create barriers as
well! Consider the home enviroment and equipment along with other
potential accessibility issues, and plan accommodations wherever
possible.</p>

teach you how to participate in <em>this</em> workshop. What kinds of
things did they do? What else could they have included?</p>

<p>At this point, you have done quite a bit of work towards planning
your workshop. We hope that alone makes your time spent here worthwhile!
However, a functioning workshop demands <strong>teamwork</strong>, and
this is especially true in an online setting. For in-person workshops, a
workshop can squeak by on a rough distribution of teaching duties with a
quick helper orientation. Online, everyone needs to be on the same page
or the workshop is really at risk. This means that, before your
workshop, you will need to bring everyone together.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>At Carpentries workshops, we want learners to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/#learners-use-their-own-machines" class="external-link">use
their own machines</a> as much as possible. This leaves them more
prepared to continue learning after the workshops. However,
troubleshooting software installation problems can be a tremendous
challenge even at an in-person event.</p>
<p>In online workshops, the inability to fully view or interact directly
with a learnerâs machine can make difficult problems functionally
unsolvable. Therefore, The Carpentries now provides <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds" class="external-link">cloud instances for each
curriculum</a>, pre-loaded with all required software and data. These
are intended to function as <strong>backups</strong> for learners who
are experiencing significant installation difficulties.</p>
<p>There are two main types of cloud instances to be used for
Carpentries workshops, each appropriate for different lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>RStudio Cloud</strong>
<ul>
<li>R-based lessons</li>
<li>Git lessons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>MyBinder</strong>
<ul>
<li>Python-based lessons</li>
<li>Shell lessons (in the absence of R or Git)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RStudio Cloud</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires sign-in</li>
<li>Starts up quickly</li>
<li>Identical interface to RStudio</li>
<li>Saves changes to the learnerâs own account</li>
<li>Does not include nano text editor (must use RStudio text
editor)</li>
</ul>
<p>MyBinder</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not require sign-in</li>
<li>Can be slow to load if not used in previous 12 hours</li>
<li>Identical interface to Jupyter Hub &amp; Jupyter Lab</li>
<li>Does not save to the cloud (must save notebooks and modified data to
desktop and re-upload)</li>
<li>Session stops after 10 minutes inactivity</li>
<li>Non-private session means that login information should not be used.
<strong>Do not connect to GitHub from MyBinder.</strong>
</li>
<li>Has nano text editor installed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you register your Carpentries workshop with us, you will receive
links to backup solutions for your event in a pre-workshop email sent by
our workshop coordinators. This email will also include information
about the caveats discussed above and a link to detailed instructions
for learners, including screenshots. We recommend that you <strong>only
share this information with those learners who have not successfully
completed installation on their own computer once the workshop has
begun.</strong></p>

<p>The Carpentries community is here to support your work! You may still
have questions, and you will almost certainly develop more as you set
about your preparations. What can you do with those questions?</p>
<p>Consider attending a <a href="https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions" class="external-link">Community
Discussion</a>! This is a great opportunity to discuss your thoughts and
questions with experienced Carpentries Instructors as well as new
trainees eager to learn from your conversation. This is also a great way
to share your experiences and engage in retrospective analysis after
your workshop is complete.</p>
<p>If you have questions about organizing your online workshop, you can
also contact <a href="../mailto:team@carpentries.org">team@carpentries.org</a> for
assistance.</p>
<p>After your workshop, please also consider whether our Recommendations
and the content of this Bonus module have served you well. If you would
like to suggest changes to either, please file an Issue in the <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training-bonus-modules/issues" class="external-link">GitHub
repository for this lesson</a>, or email your suggestions to <a href="../mailto:team@carpentries.org">team@carpentries.org</a>.</p>
<p>We would also really like to have your feedback now! If this module
has helped you to feel more prepared, or if you think there are things
we could improve, we would really appreciate hearing about this in our
post-workshop survey. Please take a moment to share your feedback with
us so that we can continue to improve our program!</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
